# ScummVM Commit Guidelines Summary

This document summarizes the key commit guidelines for the ScummVM project, based on their wiki page.

## General Commit Guidelines

*   **Atomic Commits**: Commits should contain single, related changes. Avoid combining unrelated changes (e.g., style/whitespace changes with functionality changes).
*   **Engine/Backend Compatibility**: If shared common code is changed, ensure all engine/backend code remains functional.
*   **Compilability**: ScummVM must compile with every commit to facilitate regression tracking.
*   **Documentation**: Changes to user-facing elements and common code require proper documentation.
*   **Linear History**: No merge commits are allowed; a linear history is enforced.

## Commit Message Formatting

Commit messages should follow a specific format:

`SUBSYSTEM: Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes`

`More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72`
`characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the`
`subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank`
`line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit`
`the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the`
`two together.`

`Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed`
`bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by`
`commands like git merge and git revert.`

`Further paragraphs come after blank lines.`

`- Bullet points are okay, too`

`- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a`
` single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here`

`- Use a hanging indent`

### Subsystem Names

The first line of the commit message must include a subsystem name. Common subsystems include:

*   **Engine Names**: `AGOS`, `SCI`, `SCUMM`, etc.
*   **Backend Names**: `SDL`, `ANDROID`, `WII`, `NDS`, etc.
*   **OSYSTEM**: Middleware code.
*   **I18N**: Internationalization.
*   **GUI**: All GUI-related changes.
*   **TOOLS**: ScummVM tools module or built-in tools.
*   **MIDI**: MIDI sound-related.
*   **BUILD**: Files related to building the project, makefiles.
*   **ALL**: Changes covering multiple or all subsystems.
*   **JANITORIAL**: Cross-subsystem cleanups and formatting changes.

## Documentation in Commits

Commits and Pull Requests should adhere to documentation guidelines. Documentation falls into two categories:

*   **User-facing**: Changes requiring user documentation (e.g., new GUI features, INI changes, keymaps, ports, new features) should be committed under the `DOCS` subsystem.
*   **Developer-related**: Code contributions to `common` code (outside `engines` and `backends`) must include Doxygen-style comments for new methods, signature changes, and new classes. These can be committed separately under the `DOXYGEN` subsystem. Doxygen comments are encouraged but not strictly required for `engines` and `backends`.
