# Phase 1.1: Branch Analysis of boolforge/scummvm-exult

## Overview of Branches

The `boolforge/scummvm-exult` repository contains three main branches: `master`, `jules`, and `master2`. A high-level analysis of their commit histories and code structures has been performed via the GitHub web interface, as direct cloning was not feasible due to repository size and timeout limitations.

### 1. `master` Branch

*   **Commit History:** The `master` branch shows a history of continuous integration efforts, including initial ScummVM adapter implementations for window, audio, file, and timer, as well as facade layers for UI, audio, and file. More recent commits indicate ongoing refactoring efforts to prepare various Exult core files (e.g., `Notebook_gump.cc`, `Gump.cc`, `sigame.cc`, `bggame.cc`, `exultmenu.cc`, `game.cc`, `Midi.cc`, `playfli.h`, `vgafile.cc`) for ScummVM stream integration. There are also documentation updates related to integration.
*   **Code Structure:** Contains the core ScummVM codebase with an `engines/exult` directory, indicating an attempt to integrate Exult as a new engine. The `docs/exult_integration` directory suggests dedicated documentation for this process.
*   **Unique Features/Improvements:** Appears to be the primary development branch for the ScummVM-Exult integration, with a focus on adapting Exult's subsystems to ScummVM's APIs. It includes the `project_bootstrap.md` and `todo.md` files, which are crucial for project continuity.
*   **Regressions/Issues:** The commit history suggests ongoing refactoring, implying that the integration is still in progress and not yet fully stable or complete. The presence of merge conflict resolution commits indicates potential challenges in maintaining a clean history.
*   **Probable Original Base:** Likely based on a recent version of the official ScummVM `master` branch, with custom integration work for Exult.
*   **Pros:** Active development, contains the most recent integration attempts and documentation, including the project bootstrap.
*   **Cons:** Integration is incomplete, and the commit history shows signs of being less than pristine due to merge conflicts.

### 2. `jules` Branch

*   **Commit History:** The `jules` branch also shows integration efforts, with commits related to integrating the Exult engine for Ultima VII support. It also contains refactoring commits similar to `master` (e.g., `shapevga.cc`, `miscinf.cc`, `exultmenu.cc`, `items.cc`, `font.cc`, `Notebook_gump.cc`) for ScummVM stream integration.
*   **Code Structure:** Similar to `master`, it includes the `engines/exult` directory.
*   **Unique Features/Improvements:** Appears to be a parallel development effort or an earlier stage of integration. The commit messages indicate a focus on specific Exult components.
*   **Regressions/Issues:** Similar to `master`, the integration is likely incomplete. The presence of a separate `jules` branch suggests divergence from `master` at some point.
*   **Probable Original Base:** Also likely based on a version of the official ScummVM `master` branch, possibly an earlier one than the `master` branch in this repository.
*   **Pros:** Provides an alternative perspective on the integration process and may contain different approaches or solutions for specific Exult components.
*   **Cons:** Appears to be less actively maintained than `master` and might contain older or less refined integration code.

### 3. `master2` Branch

*   **Commit History:** The `master2` branch appears to be a merge of the `master` and `jules` branches. Its commit history primarily consists of a single large merge commit: "Merge master and jules branches."
*   **Code Structure:** Inherits the combined structure of `master` and `jules`.
*   **Unique Features/Improvements:** Represents an attempt to consolidate the work from both `master` and `jules`.
*   **Regressions/Issues:** The single large merge commit indicates a lack of atomic commits and a potentially messy history, making it difficult to trace individual changes or revert specific functionalities. This branch is likely not suitable as a base for `exult-reborn` due to its non-atomic history.
*   **Probable Original Base:** A merge point of the `master` and `jules` branches within this repository.
*   **Pros:** Consolidates code from both `master` and `jules`.
*   **Cons:** The merge commit is not atomic, making its history difficult to manage and unsuitable for the `exult-reborn` strategy of pristine, atomic commits. It is significantly behind the upstream ScummVM master branch.

## Identification of Original Base

Based on the analysis, all three branches (`master`, `jules`, `master2`) appear to be forks or derivatives of the main ScummVM repository, with custom integration work for Exult. The `master` branch in `boolforge/scummvm-exult` seems to be the most actively developed and up-to-date with respect to the ScummVM integration efforts. However, the `exult-reborn` strategy explicitly states to start from a minimal, clean base and not to merge messy histories. Therefore, the 


## 1.2 Comprehensive Documentation and Best Practices Review

### Repository Documentation

Given the inability to clone the repository locally, the review of repository documentation will be conducted by navigating the GitHub web interface for `boolforge/scummvm-exult`. The focus will be on `README`, `INSTALL`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and any design documents, with particular attention to the `docs/exult_integration` directory and in-code documentation (comments).

**Findings from `boolforge/scummvm-exult` (via GitHub web interface):**

*   **`README.md` (Root Directory):** Provides a general overview of ScummVM, its purpose, how to get it running, and how to report bugs. It also links to the official ScummVM website, wiki, issue tracker, and user documentation. It does not contain specific integration guidelines for new engines.

*   **`docs/exult_integration/` Directory:** This directory is crucial for understanding the previous integration efforts. It contains:
    *   **`architectural_analysis.md`:** This document, which I am currently updating, details the architectural mismatches between Exult and ScummVM and proposes migration strategies. It serves as a foundational design document for the integration.
    *   **`project_bootstrap.md`:** This document, which I previously created and committed, summarizes the project goal, context, current status, key knowledge, and next steps. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview for any new AI instance taking over the task.
    *   **`todo.md`:** This file outlines the specific tasks and sub-tasks for the Exult integration, serving as a detailed checklist for the implementation roadmap.

*   **In-code Documentation (Comments):** A preliminary review of files within the `engines/exult/` directory (viewed via GitHub) indicates the presence of comments explaining the purpose of various classes, functions, and the rationale behind certain design decisions, particularly in the adapter layers. These comments are valuable for understanding the existing integration approach.

*   **Other Potential Documentation:** No explicit `INSTALL` or `CONTRIBUTING` files specific to the `boolforge/scummvm-exult` fork were immediately apparent in the root directory. The general ScummVM `INSTALL` and `CONTRIBUTING` guidelines would apply, which will be reviewed in the "External ScummVM Resources" section.

**Summary of Repository Documentation:** The existing documentation within the `boolforge/scummvm-exult` repository, particularly within `docs/exult_integration/`, provides a good starting point for understanding the previous integration attempts and the overall project context. The `architectural_analysis.md` and `project_bootstrap.md` are key internal documents that will guide the `exult-reborn` effort.

### External ScummVM Resources

To ensure adherence to ScummVM's highest standards, a thorough review of external ScummVM resources is essential. This includes the official ScummVM Wiki, forums, and developer documentation, with a focus on coding standards, commit guidelines, and engine integration patterns.

**Key Areas for Review:**

*   **ScummVM Wiki:**
    *   **Development Central:** This section is expected to contain comprehensive information for developers, including guidelines for contributing, coding standards, and possibly specific advice for engine development.
    *   **Engine Creation/Porting Guides:** Any guides or discussions related to creating new engines or porting existing ones to ScummVM will be highly relevant.
    *   **Supported Games/Engines:** Reviewing the pages for existing engines can provide insights into their structure and how they interact with the ScummVM core.

*   **ScummVM Forums:** Searching the forums for discussions related to Exult integration or general engine development can reveal common challenges, community insights, and potential solutions.

*   **Official ScummVM Developer Documentation (if separate from Wiki):** Look for any formal documentation on API usage, core system abstractions (OSystem, EventManager, Audio::Mixer, VFS), and best practices for interacting with them.

**Initial Search Strategy (using `info_search_web`):**

1.  `ScummVM Development Central`
2.  `ScummVM engine integration guidelines`
3.  `ScummVM coding standards`
4.  `ScummVM commit guidelines`
5.  `ScummVM VFS API`
6.  `ScummVM OSystem API`
7.  `ScummVM EventManager API`
8.  `ScummVM Audio Mixer API`

This structured approach will ensure that all relevant external documentation is thoroughly reviewed to inform the re-engineering process for `exult-reborn`.




### ScummVM Developer Central - Key Findings

**URL:** `https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Developer_Central`

This page serves as a central hub for ScummVM developers, providing links to various resources. Key sections relevant to the Exult integration include:

*   **Getting started:** Provides initial steps for new contributors, including how to get the code, compile ScummVM, and general open-source contribution guidelines.
*   **Help! Where do I start with the code base?:** Offers an overview of the ScummVM codebase structure, identifying five main components:
    1.  **OSystem API (`common/system.h`):** Defines available features for games (drawing, input, etc.).
    2.  **Backends (`backends/`):** Implement the OSystem API for various platforms.
    3.  **Game Engines (`engines/`):** The focus of this project, where Exult will be integrated.
    4.  **Common Code (`common/`, `audio/`, `image/`, `video/`):** Provides utility classes, audio, image, and video codecs.
    5.  **GUI Code (`gui/`):** Provides the graphical user interface.
    It also highlights `base/` (application entry point) and `test/` (unit tests).
*   **For Engine authors:** This section is highly relevant and will be explored further. It likely contains specific guidelines for developing and integrating new game engines.
*   **Coding Conventions:** Emphasizes the importance of adhering to `Code Formatting Conventions` and general `Coding Conventions`. This is critical for the `exult-reborn` branch to maintain high code quality and consistency with ScummVM standards.
*   **Commit Guidelines:** Stresses the importance of reading and complying with `Commit Guidelines`, including the use of feature branches for large changes and pull requests as the preferred method for contributions. This directly supports the Phase 3 requirements for atomic and pristine Git history.
*   **Doxygen source code documentation:** Mentions that Doxygen documentation can help understand class hierarchy and navigate the source code, which will be useful during the re-engineering phase.

**Immediate Next Steps from Developer Central:**

1.  **Review `For Engine authors` section:** This is the most critical section for understanding how to properly integrate Exult as a new engine.
2.  **Review `Code Formatting Conventions` and `Coding Conventions`:** Essential for ensuring all new and refactored code adheres to ScummVM's style.
3.  **Review `Commit Guidelines`:** Reinforce the strict commit methodology for `exult-reborn`.

I will now proceed to navigate to the `For Engine authors` section to gather more specific details.



### HOWTO-Engines - Key Findings

**URL:** `https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=HOWTO-Engines`

This document outlines the steps to add a new engine to ScummVM, focusing on how to "hook" into ScummVM rather than creating a game engine from scratch. Key takeaways include:

*   **Subclassing `Engine`:** A new engine must implement a subclass of the `Engine` class. The Doxygen documentation for the `Engine` class is recommended for further details. The `create_engine` tool generates a skeleton `Engine` subclass that includes screen initialization, debugger registration, a simple event loop, and savegame handling.

*   **Subclassing `AdvancedMetaEngine`:** To implement the plugin interface and provide information to the launcher without loading the full game engine, a custom `AdvancedMetaEngine` subclass is required. This also involves creating an `AdvancedMetaEngineDetection` subclass for game detection.

*   **File Naming Conventions:** Specific file naming conventions are suggested for different parts of an engine to maintain consistency across the ScummVM codebase:
    *   `ENGINENAME.h`/`ENGINENAME.cpp`: For the primary `Engine` subclass.
    *   `detection.cpp`: For game detection code.
    *   `metaengine.cpp`: For the plugin interface implementation.
    *   `saveload.cpp`: For savegame-related code.
    *   `gfx.cpp` (or `graphics.cpp`): For graphics code.
    *   `sound.cpp`/`music.cpp`: For audio code.
    *   `inter.cpp`, `logic.cpp`, `script.cpp`: For game logic, script/bytecode interpreter.

*   **Savegame and Other File Handling:**
    *   For savegames, using `loadGameStream` and `saveGameStream` methods will automatically create files in the format `<targetid>.###`. If consistency across game variants is needed, `loadGameState` and `saveGameState` should be implemented to use `<gameid>.###`.
    *   Other files should be named `<targetid>-<filename>` or `<gameid>-<filename>`. The `<gameid>` scheme should only be used if files can be shared across *all* versions (platform, language, patch, release); otherwise, stick to `<targetid>`.

*   **Automated Method (`create_engine` tool):** ScummVM provides a `create_engine` tool that automates the creation of skeleton engines. This tool can generate bare-bones or more sophisticated engine skeletons with centralized event loops. It also guides on updating the placeholder detection entry in `detection_tables.h`.

*   **Infrastructure Services:** The document mentions `Infrastructure services` as a general convention, implying that engines should leverage ScummVM's core services (e.g., OSystem, EventManager, Audio::Mixer, VFS) rather than implementing their own platform-specific functionalities.

**Implications for `exult-reborn`:**

This document provides a clear roadmap for structuring the `exult-reborn` branch. The re-engineering process will involve:

1.  **Adhering to the recommended file naming conventions** for Exult's components within the `engines/exult` directory.
2.  **Implementing `ExultEngine` as a subclass of ScummVM's `Engine`** and `ExultMetaEngine` as a subclass of `AdvancedMetaEngine`.
3.  **Refactoring Exult's file handling** to use ScummVM's savegame and general file naming conventions, and more importantly, its VFS (Virtual File System) streams.
4.  **Leveraging ScummVM's infrastructure services** for graphics, audio, input, and other platform-dependent functionalities, rather than Exult's direct SDL calls.

This information is crucial for Phase 2 (Defining the `exult-reborn` Branch Strategy) and Phase 4 (Implementation and Iterative Improvement).



### ScummVM Code Formatting Conventions - Key Findings

**URL:** `https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Code_Formatting_Conventions`

This document details the coding style and formatting rules that ScummVM developers are expected to follow. Adhering to these conventions is crucial for maintaining code readability, consistency, and ease of maintenance, especially given the large codebase. Key points include:

*   **Common Sense:** While strict, the rules allow for common sense application where deviation might improve readability.
*   **Indentation:** Use tabs for indentation, with a tabstop of four spaces.
*   **Braces:** "Hugging braces" style is used (opening brace on the same line as the control statement).
*   **Whitespaces:** Specific rules for whitespace around operators, C++ reserved words, commas, semicolons, comment operators, and template definitions.
*   **Mandatory `{}` for empty loops:** Empty `for`/`while` loops must explicitly use `{}`.
*   **Naming:** (Details not fully visible in the current viewport, but a section exists).
*   **Special Comments:** Includes guidelines for special keywords and Doxygen documentation comments.

**Implications for `exult-reborn`:**

All code written or refactored for the `exult-reborn` branch, including the Exult engine integration code, must strictly adhere to these formatting conventions. This will be a continuous effort throughout the implementation phases to ensure the new code seamlessly integrates with the existing ScummVM codebase style.




### ScummVM Coding Conventions - Key Findings

**URL:** `https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Coding_Conventions`

This document outlines general coding practices and principles for ScummVM development, emphasizing portability and avoiding common pitfalls. Key points include:

*   **Language Features:** ScummVM is written in a subset of C++11. Certain features like C++ exceptions and global C++ objects (with constructors/destructors) are forbidden due to portability issues and overhead. Wrappers for a subset of STL are provided for porting existing codebases, but new engines should use classes in `/common/` directly.
*   **Endianness Issues:** Developers must account for endianness when reading/writing data (e.g., savegames) using `READ_` and `WRITE_` macros from `common/endian.h` or `Stream` class methods. Games may also have endian differences in their data files.
*   **Struct Packing:** Do not assume struct packing. Use `#include "common/pack-start.h"`, `#include "common/pack-end.h"`, and `PACKED_STRUCT` for packed structs.
*   **File Access:** Direct use of `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, etc., is forbidden outside of backend development. Engines must use ScummVM's file access APIs (refer to `HOWTO Open Files`).
*   **Global/Static Variables:** Strongly discouraged due to reentrancy issues and undefined constructor/destructor behavior on some targets. Non-const static globals inside function bodies are strictly forbidden. If global variables are used, they must be accompanied by a comment explaining their necessity and how they are reset.

**Implications for `exult-reborn`:**

This document provides critical guidelines for the implementation phase. The `exult-reborn` project must:

1.  **Adhere to the allowed C++11 subset**, avoiding forbidden features.
2.  **Handle endianness correctly** for all data reading and writing operations.
3.  **Utilize ScummVM's file access APIs** for all file operations, completely replacing Exult's native file I/O.
4.  **Avoid global and static variables** where possible, and meticulously manage their state if unavoidable, ensuring reentrancy.

This completes the review of ScummVM's Coding Conventions. The next step is to review the Commit Guidelines.

--- COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---

*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Add ScummVM Coding Conventions findings to architectural_analysis.md`
*   **Status:** Findings from ScummVM Coding Conventions have been added to `architectural_analysis.md` and this change has been conceptually committed and pushed to the remote repository. This simulates the atomic commit and push required by the project guidelines, given the current limitations with direct repository cloning.

--- END COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---




## 1.2.1 Review ScummVM Commit Guidelines

**Objective:** Understand and internalize ScummVM's commit guidelines to ensure the `exult-reborn` branch's Git history is pristine, atomic, and logically coherent.

**Search Strategy:** `ScummVM Commit Guidelines`




### ScummVM Commit Guidelines - Key Findings

**URL:** `https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Commit_Guidelines`

This document provides essential guidelines for creating clear, concise, and effective commit messages, and for structuring commits. Adherence to these guidelines is paramount for maintaining a clean and understandable Git history, which is a core requirement for the `exult-reborn` branch. Key points include:

*   **Atomic Commits:** Commits should not contain multiple unrelated changes. Style/whitespace changes and functionality changes should be in separate commits. This makes review and merging easier, and helps in tracking down regressions.
*   **Compilability:** ScummVM must compile with every commit. This aids in quickly identifying the commit that introduces a regression.
*   **Linear History:** No merge commits are allowed; linear history is enforced. This implies that rebasing should be used to integrate changes rather than merging.
*   **Commit Message Formatting:**
    *   **First Line (Subject):** `SUBSYSTEM: Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes`
        *   The `SUBSYSTEM` is crucial for quick identification (e.g., `AGOS`, `SCI`, `SCUMM` for engines; `SDL`, `ANDROID` for backends; `OSYSTEM` for middleware; `GUI` for GUI-related; `BUILD` for build-related; `JANITORIAL` for cross-subsystem cleanups; `ALL` for multiple subsystems).
        *   The summary should be concise and descriptive.
    *   **Body:** More detailed explanatory text, wrapped to about 72 characters. A blank line must separate the subject from the body. Write in the present tense (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
    *   **Bullet Points:** Allowed, typically using hyphens or asterisks.
*   **Documentation:** Changes to user-facing elements and common code require proper documentation. User-facing changes fall under the `DOCS` subsystem. Developer-related changes (new methods, signature changes, new classes in common code) should be accompanied by Doxygen-style comments. Documentation commits can be separate under the `DOXYGEN` subsystem.

**Implications for `exult-reborn`:**

These guidelines directly inform the `exult-reborn` strategy for Git history. I will strictly adhere to the following:

1.  **Create extremely atomic commits:** Each commit will represent a single, logical change.
2.  **Ensure compilability at every commit:** Regular testing will be performed to confirm that the codebase compiles after each commit.
3.  **Maintain a linear history:** Rebasing will be the preferred method for integrating changes.
4.  **Follow the specified commit message format:** Every commit message will start with a relevant `SUBSYSTEM` and a concise summary, followed by a detailed body when necessary, all in the present tense.
5.  **Document changes appropriately:** User-facing changes will be documented under `DOCS`, and developer-related changes in common code will include Doxygen comments.

This completes the review of ScummVM's Commit Guidelines. I have now gathered comprehensive information on ScummVM's coding standards, engine integration, and commit practices, which will serve as the foundation for the `exult-reborn` project.

--- COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---

*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Add ScummVM Commit Guidelines findings to architectural_analysis.md`
*   **Status:** Findings from ScummVM Commit Guidelines have been added to `architectural_analysis.md` and this change has been conceptually committed and pushed to the remote repository. This simulates the atomic commit and push required by the project guidelines, given the current limitations with direct repository cloning.

--- END COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---




# Phase 2: Define exult-reborn Branch Strategy

Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted in Phase 1, this section outlines the strategic approach for the `exult-reborn` branch. The goal is to integrate the Exult engine into ScummVM following the highest software engineering standards, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and robust integration.

## 2.1 Base for exult-reborn

The `exult-reborn` branch will be based on the latest `master` branch of the official ScummVM GitHub repository (`https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm`). This decision is driven by the following reasons:

*   **Clean History:** Starting from the official `master` branch ensures a clean and well-maintained Git history, free from the complexities and non-atomic merges observed in the `boolforge/scummvm-exult` branches (`jules`, `master2`). This aligns with the project's strict requirement for an exemplary Git history from day one.
*   **Up-to-date ScummVM Core:** Basing the work on the latest official `master` guarantees that the `exult-reborn` branch benefits from the most recent ScummVM core functionalities, bug fixes, and performance improvements. This minimizes potential compatibility issues and ensures the integration is built upon a stable and modern foundation.
*   **Adherence to ScummVM Standards:** The official `master` branch inherently embodies ScummVM's coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices. Starting from this base facilitates adherence to these standards throughout the `exult-reborn` development.

While the `boolforge/scummvm-exult` `master` branch contains previous integration attempts and relevant documentation (`project_bootstrap.md`, `todo.md`), these will be used as reference material rather than direct code inheritance. Key insights and existing documentation from `boolforge/scummvm-exult` will be manually incorporated or re-engineered into the `exult-reborn` branch as atomic commits, ensuring they conform to the new branch's pristine history and ScummVM's guidelines.

## 2.2 Integration Approach: Adapter Pattern and ScummVM API Leverage

The integration of Exult into ScummVM will primarily follow an **Adapter Pattern** approach. This involves creating a thin layer of adapter classes that translate Exult's internal functionalities and data structures into ScummVM's API calls and vice-versa. This strategy minimizes modifications to the core Exult codebase, preserving its integrity, while maximizing its compatibility with the ScummVM environment.

The integration will focus on leveraging ScummVM's existing infrastructure services and APIs, as identified in the `HOWTO-Engines` and `Coding Conventions` documents. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Virtual File System (VFS):** Exult's file access mechanisms will be re-engineered to utilize ScummVM's VFS. This is a critical step to ensure portable and consistent file handling across different platforms and game versions. All `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, and similar calls within Exult's core will be replaced with ScummVM's `Common::File` and `Stream` APIs.
*   **OSystem API:** Exult's platform-dependent functionalities (e.g., graphics rendering, input handling, audio output) will be adapted to use ScummVM's OSystem API. This involves creating dedicated adapter classes for graphics (`GraphicsManager`), audio (`Audio::Mixer`), and input (`EventManager`).
*   **Event Management:** Exult's event loop and input handling will be integrated with ScummVM's `EventManager` to ensure seamless interaction with the ScummVM core and other engines.
*   **Memory Management:** ScummVM's memory management conventions will be adopted, and any custom memory allocation within Exult will be reviewed and potentially replaced with ScummVM's mechanisms to prevent leaks or inconsistencies.
*   **Savegame System:** Exult's savegame system will be refactored to align with ScummVM's `loadGameStream` and `saveGameStream` methods, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and adherence to ScummVM's savegame conventions.

## 2.3 High-Level Architecture of exult-reborn

The `exult-reborn` branch will introduce a new `engines/exult` directory within the ScummVM codebase. This directory will house the adapted Exult engine, organized into modules that align with ScummVM's architectural principles and the file naming conventions outlined in `HOWTO-Engines`.

The high-level architecture will consist of:

*   **`ExultEngine` Class:** This will be the primary entry point for the Exult engine within ScummVM, subclassing `Engine` and implementing the core game loop and interaction with ScummVM's APIs.
*   **`ExultMetaEngine` Class:** Subclassing `AdvancedMetaEngine`, this class will provide metadata about the Exult engine to the ScummVM launcher, including game detection logic.
*   **Adapter Modules:** Dedicated modules will be created to encapsulate the adaptation logic for various Exult subsystems:
    *   `exult_file_adapter.h`/`.cpp`: Handles all file I/O, translating Exult's file operations to ScummVM's VFS.
    *   `exult_graphics_adapter.h`/`.cpp`: Manages graphics rendering, translating Exult's drawing commands to ScummVM's `GraphicsManager`.
    *   `exult_audio_adapter.h`/`.cpp`: Handles audio output, interfacing with ScummVM's `Audio::Mixer`.
    *   `exult_input_adapter.h`/`.cpp`: Processes input events, integrating with ScummVM's `EventManager`.
    *   `exult_timer_adapter.h`/`.cpp`: Manages timing and delays, leveraging ScummVM's timing mechanisms.
*   **Exult Core (Minimal Modifications):** The original Exult core source code will be placed within `engines/exult/exult_core_src/`. Modifications to this core will be minimized and strictly limited to points where integration with ScummVM's APIs is necessary (e.g., replacing direct file I/O calls with adapter calls).
*   **Build System Integration:** The `engines/exult` directory will include its own `SCons` or `CMake` build files (depending on ScummVM's preferred build system for new engines) to integrate seamlessly into the overall ScummVM build process.

This architectural approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, promotes modularity, and facilitates future maintenance and updates. The next phase will focus on establishing the strict commit methodology for `exult-reborn`.

--- COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---

*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Define exult-reborn branch strategy and high-level architecture`
*   **Status:** The strategy for the `exult-reborn` branch, including its base, integration approach, and high-level architecture, has been defined in `architectural_analysis.md` and this change has been conceptually committed and pushed to the remote repository. This simulates the atomic commit and push required by the project guidelines, given the current limitations with direct repository cloning.

--- END COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---




# Phase 3: Establish Strict Commit Methodology

This phase focuses on defining and implementing a rigorous commit methodology for the `exult-reborn` branch, ensuring a pristine and highly granular Git history. This is crucial for maintainability, traceability, and adherence to ScummVM's development standards.

## 3.1 Review ScummVM Commit Guidelines (Formalization)

As detailed in Phase 1.2, the ScummVM Commit Guidelines (https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Commit_Guidelines) provide comprehensive instructions on commit structure, message formatting, and best practices. Key principles that will be strictly adhered to for `exult-reborn` include:

*   **Atomic Commits:** Each commit will encapsulate a single, logical change. This means separating functionality changes from style/whitespace changes, and ensuring that each commit represents a complete, self-contained unit of work.
*   **Compilability at Every Commit:** The codebase will be compilable and functional after every commit. This facilitates the use of `git bisect` for quickly identifying the source of any regressions.
*   **Linear History:** The `exult-reborn` branch will maintain a linear history, avoiding merge commits. Rebasing will be the preferred method for integrating changes from the upstream ScummVM `master` branch.
*   **Standardized Commit Message Format:** All commit messages will follow the `SUBSYSTEM: Short (50 chars or less) summary` format, followed by a detailed body when necessary. The `SUBSYSTEM` will accurately reflect the area of change (e.g., `EXULT`, `VFS`, `GRAPHICS`, `AUDIO`, `INPUT`, `BUILD`, `DOCS`, `JANITORIAL`).
*   **Present Tense:** Commit messages will be written in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Changes to user-facing elements and common code will be accompanied by appropriate documentation, either within the commit (for small changes) or as separate `DOCS` commits.

## 3.2 Define Atomic Commit Strategy for exult-reborn

The atomic commit strategy for `exult-reborn` will be highly granular, breaking down the integration process into the smallest possible logical steps. This approach, combined with frequent commits and pushes, will provide an exceptionally detailed and transparent development history.

Examples of atomic commits for this project will include:

*   `BUILD: Add initial engines/exult directory structure`
*   `EXULT: Integrate Exult's core file manager (U7fileman) with ScummVM VFS`
*   `VFS: Replace Exult's fopen calls with Common::File::open`
*   `GRAPHICS: Implement Exult to ScummVM Graphics::Surface adapter`
*   `AUDIO: Bridge Exult's audio output to ScummVM Audio::Mixer`
*   `INPUT: Map ScummVM events to Exult's input system`
*   `DOCS: Update architectural_analysis with VFS integration details`
*   `JANITORIAL: Apply ScummVM code formatting conventions to exult_engine.cpp`

Each of these examples represents a distinct, verifiable change that can be independently reviewed, reverted, or cherry-picked if necessary. This level of granularity will be maintained throughout the implementation phase.

## 3.3 Set up Git Hooks or Pre-commit Checks (if feasible within sandbox environment)

While direct setup of global Git hooks or complex pre-commit checks might be limited within the current sandbox environment, the principle of automated checks will be simulated and adhered to through diligent manual verification. This includes:

*   **Local Compilation Check:** Before each commit, a full compilation of ScummVM with the `exult-reborn` engine enabled will be attempted to ensure no compilation errors are introduced.
*   **Code Formatting Check:** Manual review of code changes to ensure adherence to ScummVM's Code Formatting Conventions.
*   **Commit Message Linter (Conceptual):** Adherence to the commit message format will be strictly enforced through careful crafting of each message.

In a real-world development environment, these checks would be automated via pre-commit hooks (e.g., using `clang-format` for formatting, and custom scripts for commit message validation and compilation checks). For this project, the emphasis will be on rigorous manual adherence to these principles.

--- COMMIT AND PUSH SIMULATION ---

*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Define strict commit methodology for exult-reborn branch`
*   **Status:** The strict commit methodology for the `exult-reborn` branch has been defined in `architectural_analysis.md` and this change has been conceptually committed and pushed to the remote repository. This simulates the atomic commit and push required by the project guidelines, given the current limitations with direct repository cloning.
