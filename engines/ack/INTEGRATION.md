# Integration Guide for ACK Engine in ScummVM

This document provides detailed instructions for integrating the ACK (Adventure Construction Kit) engine into the ScummVM project.

## Prerequisites

- ScummVM source code (https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm)
- C++ compiler compatible with ScummVM requirements
- Basic knowledge of ScummVM architecture

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add Engine Files

Copy the entire `ack` directory to the `engines/` directory in your ScummVM source tree:

```bash
cp -r ack_engine_final/ /path/to/scummvm/engines/ack/
```

### 2. Update Build Configuration

Add the ACK engine to the engines list in `engines/engines.mk`:

```makefile
# Find this section in engines/engines.mk
ENGINES := \
	agi \
	bladerunner \
	...
	zvision \
	ack
```

### 3. Update configure Script

Add the ACK engine to the configure script (`configure`) to allow enabling/disabling the engine:

Find the section with engine definitions and add:

```
add_engine ack "Adventure Construction Kit" yes
```

### 4. Rebuild ScummVM

Rebuild ScummVM with the new engine:

```bash
./configure
make
```

## Testing the Integration

After building ScummVM with the ACK engine, you can test it with ACK games:

1. Place your ACK game files in a directory
2. Run ScummVM and add the game through the launcher
3. Select the game and click "Start"

## Debugging

If you encounter issues with the engine:

1. Enable debug output with `-d1` command line option
2. Use the built-in console (press Ctrl+F5 during gameplay)
3. Check the ScummVM log for error messages

## Known Limitations

- Some advanced ACK features may not be fully implemented
- Custom sound formats might require additional decoders
- Some games may require specific workarounds

## Contributing Improvements

If you make improvements to the engine, please consider contributing them back to the ScummVM project:

1. Create a fork of the ScummVM repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes
